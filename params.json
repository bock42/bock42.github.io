My work involves developing software in Matlab to process large MRI data sets, as well as create, present, and analyze various visual stimuli for use in functional MRI experiments. In addition, I train and mentor graduate students, undergraduates, and research staff members\r\n\r\n# Matlab Toolboxes\r\n###matMRI\r\nToolbox for preprocessing magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data in Matlab\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bock42/matMRI\r\n\r\n###matStimuli\r\nToolbox for creating and displaying various visual stimuli in Matlab\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bock42/matStimuli\r\n\r\n# Matlab Projects\r\n###TemplateRetinotopy\r\nProject repository for the automatic identification of cortical retinotopic organization using functional correlations\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bock42/TemplateRetinotopy\r\n\r\n###motionResp\r\nScripts to investigate the influences of respiration and motion in MRI data\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bock42/motionResp\r\n\r\n# Selected Publications / Presentations\r\n###Journal Articles\r\n\r\nBock, A., et al.
